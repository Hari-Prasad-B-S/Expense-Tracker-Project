# Expense-Tracker-Project
The Expense Tracker is a Java based application designed to help users manage their daily financial transactions efficiently. The project allows users to add and view expenses while categorizing them (e.g., food, travel, bills, shopping). It maintains a record of all expenses and provides a summary report to help users analyze their spendings.
